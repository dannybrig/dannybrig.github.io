excerpt: 'This method enhances the ability of pretrained classifiers to detect and reject unknown objects in infra-red images without altering their performance on known classes. It introduces a secondary network trained using regression to produce a class-conditional score, indicating whether an input belongs to a known class. Operating within a Bayesian framework, the approach combines the primary classifier's confidence with the secondary network's score to separate known targets from unknown objects effectively. Notably, the method does not require examples of out-of-distribution (OOD) imagery for training.'
