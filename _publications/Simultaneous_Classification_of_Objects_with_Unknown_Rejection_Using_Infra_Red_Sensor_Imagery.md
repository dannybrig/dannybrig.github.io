excerpt: 'This method enhances the ability of pretrained classifiers to detect and reject unknown objects in infra-red images without altering their performance on known classes. It introduces a secondary network trained using regression to produce a class-conditional score, indicating whether an input belongs to a known class. We then combine the primary classifier's confidence with the secondary network's score to separate known targets from unknown objects effectively.'

This method enhances the ability of pretrained classifiers to detect and reject unknown objects in infra-red images without altering their performance on known classes. It introduces a secondary network trained using regression to produce a class-conditional score, indicating whether an input belongs to a known class. We then combine the primary classifier's confidence with the secondary network's score to separate known targets from unknown objects effectively.
