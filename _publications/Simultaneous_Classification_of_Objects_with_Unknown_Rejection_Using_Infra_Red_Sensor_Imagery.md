excerpt: 'Continual Learners commonly employ replay as a method for mitigating catastrophic forgetting where we store few previous examples in a memory buffer and replay them when learning a new task. Replay commonly uses random sampling strategies to populate the buffer which can potentially store uninformative/redundant data and overwrite informative data. This works explore replacements to reservoir sampling for less forgetting when using replay methods.'

Continual Learners commonly employ replay as a method for mitigating catastrophic forgetting where we store few previous examples in a memory buffer and replay them when learning a new task. Replay commonly uses random sampling strategies (e.g., reservoir sampling) to populate the buffer which can potentially store uninformative/redundant data and overwrite informative data. This works explores replacements to reservoir sampling for less forgetting when using replay methods.
