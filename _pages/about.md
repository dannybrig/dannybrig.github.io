I am a PhD student at the University of Arizona studying under Prof. Abhijit Mahalanobis. My research interests mainly consist of computer vision applications spanning the areas of continual learning, federated learning, Bayesian deep learning and general machine learning and deep learning.

Prior to my PhD studies, I was a data scientist as Naval Information Warfare Center (NIWC) Atlantic where my computer vision interests began by working alongside Dr. Jesus Caban at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center.
